            <p>Hello! My name is Bradley Crawford and I am from Alberta, Canada. This year I was able to get married to my wonderful wife and have been enjoying everyday since. When I am not doing schoolwork I like to relax my playing some videogames like Minecraft, Subnautica, and Stardew Valley. These help me recharge and allow me to channel my creativity using them as a medium. </p>
